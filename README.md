# React Error Boundary Project

This project demonstrates the use of React's `ErrorBoundary` component to catch JavaScript errors in child components and display a fallback UI. The component leverages React’s `componentDidCatch` lifecycle method to handle errors gracefully, ensuring that the app can recover or display an error message without crashing.

## Features

- **Error Handling**: Captures errors that occur in child components and prevents them from affecting the entire application.
- **Custom Fallback UI**: Displays a custom error image when an error is caught, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
- **Error Logging**: Logs the error details and component stack trace to the console for debugging purposes.
- **Modular Design**: The `ErrorBoundary` component can be easily wrapped around any part of your app to protect it from crashes due to unhandled exceptions.

## Project Structure

- **`ErrorBoundary.js`**: Defines the `ErrorBoundary` component, which uses the `componentDidCatch` lifecycle method to catch errors and render a fallback image when an error is encountered.
- **`index.js`**: The entry point for the React application. It imports and renders the root `App` component, which is wrapped in the `ErrorBoundary` component to handle errors globally.
- **`error.webp`**: The image displayed as a fallback when an error occurs in any child component.

## How It Works

1. **Error Handling**: 
   The `ErrorBoundary` component wraps child components and listens for any errors that occur within them. If an error occurs, the `componentDidCatch` method is triggered, allowing error handling logic to be executed.

2. **Custom Fallback UI**: 
   When an error is caught, the component sets the `hasError` state to `true`, and instead of rendering its children, it displays an error image (`error.webp`) to the user.

3. **Error Logging**: 
   The `componentDidCatch` method logs the error and additional information about the error to the console. This is useful for debugging and can be extended to send error reports to external monitoring services.

## Key Methods

- **`componentDidCatch(error, info)`**: 
  This lifecycle method is called when a JavaScript error is thrown in a child component. It logs the error details and updates the component state to trigger the fallback UI.

## Project Files

- **`ErrorBoundary.js`**: The component responsible for error handling and fallback rendering.
- **`index.js`**: The main entry point of the app that initializes and renders the `App` component, ensuring that the entire app is wrapped within the `ErrorBoundary`.
- **`error.webp`**: An image that is displayed when an error occurs in any child component.
